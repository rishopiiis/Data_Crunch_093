CSE-40 - DATA CRUNCH
This project tackles the challenge of predicting weather patterns in Harvestonâ€”a fictional agricultural region facing increasing climate instability. Using historical temperature, rainfall, radiation, and wind data, we developed a machine learning system to forecast future conditions. Our solution combines feature engineering, ensemble modeling (LightGBM, XGBoost, and neural networks), and domain-specific post-processing to generate actionable insights for farmers. The goal is to optimize crop planning, improve resource management, and mitigate risks from erratic weather. This repository contains the complete pipeline from data preprocessing to model deployment, demonstrating a practical application of ML for climate resilience in agriculture.
